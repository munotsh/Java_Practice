- what was your biggest achievement?
- how did you handled deadlines which you didn't make?
- how did you manage difficult colleagues?
- what do you think about deadlines?
- do you know how deadlines work?
- what can you say to satisfy my low-level developer ego by talking about your experiences without talking about yoursef?
